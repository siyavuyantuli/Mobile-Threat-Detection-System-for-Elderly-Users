# Mobile-Threat-Detection-System-for-Elderly-Users
Mobile Threat Detection System for Elderly Users is a research-driven project that aims to enhance mobile cybersecurity for elderly individuals, who are often more vulnerable to mobile-specific threats such as phishing, malicious apps, and social engineering attacks.

The system leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques — including Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid Random Forest–LSTM model — to accurately identify and classify potential threats based on behavioral, device, and contextual features.

🔍 Key Features

Detection of mobile-specific threats in real time

Integration of user behavior and device characteristics

Hybrid ML–DL model for improved detection accuracy

Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation pipeline

Designed with a focus on elderly user safety and digital inclusion

🧠 Technologies Used

Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook for model training and evaluation

Random Forest, LSTM, and Hybrid RF–LSTM algorithms
